**Description**: This workshop will provide an overview of mesoscale particle-based modeling techniques, 
including coarse-grained interactions, molecular  dynamics, Brownian dynamics, and multiparticle collision dynamics. 
A session on good citizenship in the computational-science community, including reproducibility, data sharing, and 
interacting with open-source  software, will also be facilitated. The workshop will feature a mix of lectures and 
hands-on exercises (roughly 50% each) using HOOMD-blue on national  supercomputing resources.

**Application Form**: https://forms.gle/CHNNXTSdZwecT1N98

**Eligibility:** graduate student, undergraduate student (with junior or senior standing), postdoctoral, early career faculty

**Registration Fee:** The registration fee is $150 and will be waived for participants from US-based non-PhD-granting and primary undergraduate institutions (PUIs).

**Financial Aid:** Financial support is available to cover housing (in the university dormitory) for all non-local participants.

**Expected number of participants:** 50

**Equipment Needed:** Students will need a laptop, and have Jupyter notebooks installed. Computing resources for performing exercises will be provided in Bridges-2 at PSC
