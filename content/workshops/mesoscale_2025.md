Description: This workshop will provide an overview of mesoscale particle-based modeling techniques, 
including coarse-grained interactions, molecular  dynamics, Brownian dynamics, and multiparticle collision dynamics. 
A session on good citizenship in the computational-science community, including reproducibility, data sharing, and 
interacting with open-source  software, will also be facilitated. The workshop will feature a mix of lectures and 
hands-on exercises (roughly 50% each) using HOOMD-blue on national  supercomputing resources.
