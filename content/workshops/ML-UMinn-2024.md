**Description:** This workshop will provide an overview of machine learning tools applied to study molecular systems with a focus on computational molecular science. It will feature a mix of lectures and hands-on exercises running machine learning algorithms with molecular simulations on national supercomputing resources. The workshop will include a session on diversity, equity, and inclusion aspects of computational sciences. Sessions will be taught in Software Carpentry style, with approximately equal time divided between lectures and hands-on programming exercises.

**Registration:**
