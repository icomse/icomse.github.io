Description: Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation techniques have become essential tools in understanding thermophysical and phase equilibria properties of systems ranging from organic liquids to ionic liquids, polymers, biomolecules, solutions, zeolites, metal organic frameworks and covalent organic frameworks, etc. These techniques are based on statistical mechanics principles and enable one to access length scales spanning tens of nanometers and sample timescales up to hundreds of nanoseconds. This course will focus on the theoretical underpinnings of MC and MD simulations and techniques for computing macroscopic properties such as self-diffusion coefficients, ionic conductivity, viscosity, vapor-liquid equilibria and gas absorption/adsorption isotherms. The open-source software packages Gromacs and Cassandra will be used for the hands-on tutorial sessions.
