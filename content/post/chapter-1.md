Applications are now open for the Molecular Dynamics / Monte Carlo Summer School at Boise State University. Classical molecular dynamics and molecular modeling are essential modeling tools for materials including proteins, polymers, and ionic liquids, in applications ranging from pharmaceutical development to materials science.  This course will present a theoretical and practical introduction to classical statistical mechanics and molecular modeling on high-performance computers. The open source software GROMACS and LAMMPS  will be used for hands-on tutorial sessions.
