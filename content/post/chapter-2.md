Applications are now open for the i-CoMSE Mesoscale Modeling Summer Workshop at Mississippi State University.  This workshop 
will provide an overview of mesoscale particle-based modeling techniques, including coarse-grained interactions, molecular dynamics, Brownian dynamics, and multiparticle collision dynamics.
