Applications are now open for the Machine Learning for Molecular Sciences Workshop at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.  This 
workshop will provide an overview of machine learning tools applied to study molecular systems with a focus on computational molecular 
science. It will feature a mix of lectures and hands-on exercises running machine learning algorithms with molecular simulations on 
national supercomputing resources.
