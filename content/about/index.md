i-CoMSE is focused on serving the needs of the community engaged in fundamental research in computational molecular science and engineering (CMSE) by:
- Providing an ecosystem for nurturing and training the next generation of computational molecular scientists and engineers.
- Increasing availability and accessibility of well-curated education materials and content in computational molecular modeling, and content, both through workshops and online resources.
- Serving as a node for engagement with the relevant stakeholders and promoting fundamental research in CMSE.
- Broadening participation through recruitment and training of underrepresented groups in CMSE at institutions with low cyberinfrastructure (CI) penetration.

Over the course of next four years, we plan to implement suitable governance and revenue model that make the institute self-sustaining after the end of support from the National Science Foundation.

The Institute aims to provide an inclusive and supporting environment for everyone regardless of age, gender, background, race, and national origin. Participants (in-person or virtual) are expected to contribute to an inclusive learning environment, including respect for different viewpoints, using welcoming language, and giving and receiving constructive feedback. Please view our diversity and inclusion statement there (link to separate new simple text page).
